## CODING FILES:

[JC_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/JC_Analysis.ipynb): this python file contains the main part of my work including data overview, data cleaning, data aggregation and statistic analysis.

[JC_Age22_Campaign](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/JC_Age22_Campaign.ipynb): this python file merged all available information from three original datasets. It returned a dataset that used to predict whether a recipient would open up the sent email.

[JC_Predictive](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/JC_Predictive.ipynb): this python file is used to clean the dataset returned from JC_Age22_Campaign, ensuring the data format is available for machine learning model.

[JC_kNN](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/JC_kNN.py): this python file builds up a kNN predictive model to forecast whether the receiver will open the email.

## DATASETS:

[email_sent_response_sample.tsv](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/email_sent_response_sample.tsv): this is the sample of total email_sent_response dataset which contains all outcome after consolidating and aggregating emails.tsv and email_response.tsv

[members_info.tsv](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/members_info.tsv): this is the dataset extracted from original members.tsv, supported statistical analysis and predictive modeling

[profit_state.tsv](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/profit_state.tsv): this is the dataset describing the profit generated by each state.

[age22_campaign_pred.tsv](https://github.com/yding06/email-marketing-analysis/blob/master/age22_campaign_pred.tsv): this is the final dataset used as the input to the kNN predictive model.
